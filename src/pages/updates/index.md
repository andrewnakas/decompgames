## October 10, 2026 — Skate 3: online rooms, community maps, regenerated geometry

The Skate 3 clean-room build now has multiplayer: open a private room and send the invite link, or a public room that anyone can join from the Multiplayer menu, for up to ten skaters on the same map. The map picker lists community maps published on skatemods.com and opens `.skate` files from your own disk. The visual geometry of every park and the skater is now regenerated like the textures and sounds, and a ninth park, built from Kenney's CC0 Mini Skate kit, has been added. Multiplayer has only been checked between two test browsers so far. [Play Skate 3](/games/skate-3/).

## October 1, 2026 — Clean-room builds and a new design

The catalogue now leads with 17 clean-room builds: 16 Nintendo 64 games and Skate 3. Each runs decompiled or rewritten game code with regenerated assets and plays in place on its game page, with gamepad support. The site has been redesigned around the game grid, and link-only directory entries have been removed. [How the clean room works](/clean-room/).

## September 27, 2026 — Open Junction is playable

Open Junction pairs the documented reSL decompilation with independently authored CC0 art, interface, and six-station scenario data. The pinned WebAssembly build excludes original game resources and uses a null audio backend. Muted private tests covered player-built rails, switch routing, natural train deliveries, Save/Archive, and six-station cases. The deployed package passed a natural completed-train delivery and a save export/delete/import/restore cycle in an isolated, silent browser test. Uninterrupted 1800–2000 progression and the repeat-level campaign remain unverified. [Play Open Junction](/games/shortline/).

## September 22, 2026 — Open Paths is playable

Open Paths combines the documented OpenSupaplex decompilation with six original CC0 navigation mazes and independently generated graphics, screens, fonts, palettes, and panel data. The null-audio WebAssembly build passed muted local and production tests for launch, menu input, player creation, movement, first-level completion, fresh-start progress, and backup export/delete/import restoration. The full six-level playthrough remains unverified.

## September 22, 2026 — Open Digger is playable

Open Digger combines the documented Digger Remastered decompilation with eight new levels and independently generated CC0 graphics, font, title, and icon data. The no-audio browser build passed muted launch, input, collection, scoring, first-level completion, second-level enemy and death/restart checks, origin-local storage reload, and the live Decomp Games player flow. The game page states the exact tested scope.

## September 18, 2026 — Building the first collection

The first catalog brings decompilations, engine recreations, and released-source ports into one searchable collection. Game pages separate asset requirements from engine licenses and publish explicit verification records.

The browser player and initial integrations are in development. The public-release gate is eight complete instant-play titles, two local-import integrations, and 30 substantive project entries. Check individual game pages for current availability and test scope.
